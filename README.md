## Design Choices

### Fonts
I have used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to find a text that best suits the feel of the website.
I have mostly used "Roboto", "Lato" and "Oswald" for most of the site. "Robot" will be used for the Body and "lato" for the the Time Line.

### Icons
I have chosen to use the amazing icons supplied from [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"). These logos are easy to interpret and are free to use on the website

### Colours
I have used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/ "coolors") to generate a suitable palette for my colour scheme. 


I will explain the uses of the varius colours below, starting from top to bottom.


![Colour Pallet](/wireframes/coolors-palette.png)


 
 * --imperial-red: #e63946ff;
 * --honeydew: #f1faeeff;
 * --powder-blue: #a8dadcff;
 * --celadon-blue: #457b9dff;
 * --prussian-blue: #1d3557ff;

### Structure

I have decided to use Flex for creating a resposive layout over Bootstrap. I preferred flex over bootstrap due to the easy in style my webiste and ot worry about the Specifity issue created by importing the bootstrap library.

# Wireframes
I have used [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/ "Balsamic") to develop my wireframes for my website. I initially created the mobile version and then the wireframes and then scalled it up for both tablet and desktop. Because a requirement is to give little but quality information to the user to make them want to engage with the club, a one-page website is used. This gets the user through the content and quickly to the contact form and details via scrolling or directly via the navigation bar.

The wireframes are below:


### [Desktop Wireframe]( "Desktop wireframe")
### [Tablet Wireframe]( "Tablet wireframe")
### [Phone Wireframe]( "Phone wireframe")
